Questions:
- what do we use as commit messages on the undo branch?
- can we really just commit the whole file every time a coalesced group of edits is pushed onto or popped off of the undo manager?
	- do NSUndoManager instances know about documents?
		I don’t recall them doing so, but we can add that to the subclass’ API.
		- what will this mean for performance with large files?
			- do we care?
