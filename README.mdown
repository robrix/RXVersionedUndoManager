#RXVersionedUndoManager

An experimental undo manager subclass which saves undo state to a git branch.

Spawned by a conversation between @rob_rix and @rentzsch on Twitter. The premise:

> Binding the undo manager to git so you could branch and merge easily. Have the undo manager commits in a separate branch and then merge them into master with nice commit messages.
